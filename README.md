- Console app for offline password management

## ‚ú® Technologies

* Python
* PostgreSQL

## Functionality

- One *MASTER* password to get in (**Argon2** hashed)
- Add, edit, delete, show by id, list all, list all containing some text
- Storing **URL, username and password**
- Passwords encrypted with AES-256 (GCM Mode)
    - 32-bytes KEY is used for encryption/decryption
- Uses auto **generated password** if no password was passed
- Checking if passwords are compromised (**haveibeenpwned's API**)
- Asking to confirm deleting a record / using compromised password
- Generated password **copied to clipboard** when chosen
---
- *MASTER* password and encryption *KEY* stored in the **.env** file and loaded as environment variables

## Dependencies

- **argon2**: Hashing algorithm
- **psycopg2**: PostgreSQL client for Python
- **pycryptodome**: Cryptography functions
- **python-dotenv**: Loads environment variables by reading them from a .env file
- **requests**: HTTP library

Install them all using:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Improving it
- Make better CLI (use the ***click*** package)
- Store KEY in **.bin** file
- Use the prepared *logger.py* to implement logging and save all logs to a **.log** file
- Ability to change MASTER password
- Exception Handling for the execution of SQL
- New KEY to be generated using *PBKDF2* (password + salt needed)
